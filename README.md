prison_scrape
=============

This is some simple code to scrape data on US prisons from [insideprison.com][insideprison]. It's being used to power the [@USPrisons][bot] twitter bot.

=======

Since the source data is licensed as [CC BY-SA 3.0][license], so is the data here, and the code to generate it. The only real changes are converting from HTML to JSON, and making some of the numeric data a little cleaner to read. Any thanks for the existence of the data should go to [insideprison.com][insideprison].
