prison_scrape
=============

This is some simple code to scrape data on US prisons from [insideprison.com](http://insideprison.com). It's being used to power the [@USPrisons](https://twitter.com/usprisons) twitter bot.

Since the source data is licensed as [CC BY-SA 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en_US), so is the data here, and the code to generate it. The only real changes are converting from HTML to JSON, and making some of the numeric data a little cleaner to read. Any thanks for the existence of the data should go to [insideprison.com](http://insideprison.com).
